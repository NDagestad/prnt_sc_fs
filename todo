* Delay finding the image url untile file opening -> doing it during the get_attr phase takes to
  much time as a program waits to have read all attributs before showing the output to the user
* Find a way to get the image size before during the getattr phase.
	* Maybe get the image url and cache it on disque for reuse later
	* Then use http HEAD to get the file size
